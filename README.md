Here, we can see all necessary functions or syntax or code used in css. it is an tutorial based programs.
I program all this during my learning phase.
So here, details of this particular repo. can not be worthfull. cause these are all basics and not a projects.

what kind of files you can get here here:-
1. Mostly all Concept of css based programs.
2. then practices set.

   this is the sequence of files, you can consider practices set as a very tiny project. cause in  this i apply every thing that i learn in phases.
   there are 1 to 7 sets and in each set i apply my learings for practice.
